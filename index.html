What is SASS ?

    * Sass is an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language. 
    * It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. 
    * Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and running quickly, particularly with the help of 
    the Compass style library.

Features:

    * Fully CSS-compatible
    * Language extensions such as variables, nesting, and mixins
    * Many useful functions for manipulating colors and other values
    * Advanced features like control directives for libraries
    * Well-formatted, customizable output

Syntax: 

    SASS: Files using this syntax have the .scss extension.

        There are two syntaxes available for Sass. The first, known as SCSS (Sassy CSS) and used throughout this reference, 
        is an extension of the syntax of CSS. This means that every valid CSS stylesheet is a valid SCSS file with the same meaning. 
        In addition, SCSS understands most CSS hacks and vendor-specific syntax, such as IE's old filter syntax. 
        This syntax is enhanced with the Sass features described below. 
        Files using this syntax have the .scss extension.

    SCSS: Files using this syntax have the .sass extension.
        
        More popular and recommended.
        The second and older syntax, known as the indented syntax (or sometimes just "Sass"), provides a more concise way of writing CSS. 
        It uses indentation rather than brackets to indicate nesting of selectors, and newlines rather than semicolons to separate 
        properties. Some people find this to be easier to read and quicker to write than SCSS. The indented syntax has all the 
        same features, although some of them have slightly different syntax; this is described in the indented syntax reference. 
        Files using this syntax have the .sass extension.
